{"name":"Farm-build-prototype","tagline":"This project is a sample to show the complete cycle of development, test and qa in farm build project.","body":"Delivering spatial information for improved management of individual farms, entire\r\nlandscapes and sub-regions is critical for productivity improvement, land and water\r\nmanagement and to support farm extension activities.\r\n\r\n#Driver for the Research\r\n\r\nAs part of the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR) on-line\r\ninitiatives the FarmWeb 2.0 project will design, deploy and evaluate a web 2.0 spatial mapping and data\r\nmanagement program to enable farmers to improve productivity while reducing their environmental impact.\r\nAgricultural industries are coming under increased external scrutiny from customers and regulators to\r\ndemonstrate environmental compliance. Over the last decade DEDJTR has taken the lead in investigating\r\nthe link between on-farm actions, productivity and environmental outcomes.\r\n\r\n#Research Focus\r\n\r\nThe initial focus of this work will be applications in the Dairy industry. DEDJTR will work collaboratively with\r\nMurray Goulburn Cooperative (MGC) Ltd to develop, trial and deploy a FarmWeb 2.0 on-line mapping and\r\nnutrient management tool with their farmers.\r\nThe developed systems will aim to provide a two way flow of data between government, industry and\r\nfarmers/landholders.\r\n\r\n#Project Objectives.\r\nThe objectives of the Gardiner project “FarmWeb 2.0: A web-based nutrient topic package for the Victorian\r\nDairy Industry are:\r\n1. To design, test and deploy, in conjunction with Murray Goulburn, a Web-based Nutrient\r\nManagement Topic Package (as a case study for the wider dairy industry) to examine the potential\r\nto demonstrate on-farm best nutrient management practices.\r\n2. To evaluate and communicate the usefulness and usability of a Web-based topic package as spatial\r\ninformation tools for better production and Natural Resource Management outcomes on Victorian\r\ndairy farms.\r\n\r\n#Farm Build Nutrient Calculator\r\n\r\nThis is the nutrient calculator module of farm build javaScript library.\r\n\r\nA nutrient balance calculator for Australian dairy farms:\r\nIn partnership with Murray Goulburn, DEDJTR has developed the science based ‘Dairy Farm Nutrient\r\nBalance Model’. This javaScript library can be used to model nutrient flow in and out of your dairy farm. Since\r\nAustralian dairy farms generally import larger quantities of nutrients than they export, knowing the nutrient\r\nstatus of your farm gives you the potential to save money.\r\n\r\n#What is a nutrient balance calculator?\r\nThe nutrient balance model determines how efficiently a nutrient is being used on-farm. The amount of a\r\nnutrient leaving in farm products (milk or animals) is subtracted from nutrient inputs to calculate the nutrient\r\nbalance (kg of nutrient per ha of land).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator works with yearly totals. The following is the list of functions provided in this modules:\r\n* Numbers of Animals purchased for the year (Heavy Cattle, Average Cattle, Yearlings, Weaned\r\nyoung stock and Bobby Calves).\r\n* Forage Purchased (Hay and Silage) (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).\r\n* Concentrate Purchased (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).\r\n* Fertiliser Purchased (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).\r\n* Number of Sold and Culled Cows (Heavy Cattle, Average Cattle, Yearlings, Weaned young stock\r\nand Bobby Calves).\r\n* Milk Sold, Total Milk for Year (Litres) Total Fat/Protein (kg) Fat (kg/%) and Protein (kg/%).\r\n* Legume – Whole Farm average legume percentage (%) the percentage of pasture legumes growing\r\nof the farm.","google":"UA-53478356-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
